**A.1.** Indentification of functional requirements:

1) **New user registration:** Any new student/member of the institution who wants to use the facilities of the library needs to be a member of the Library Information System. For this, new user has to register himself. After registrating successfuly, every user is assigned a new user ID and password. To issue books, a user must login with these credentials before.
2) **User login:** After a member has registered successfully, they can use the user id and password to login to the Library Information System. If the login is successful, the user is taken to the home page from where they can issue, return, or extend the return deadline. On an unsuccessful login attempt, the user is shown a login failure message and returned back. In case of three consecutive unsuccessful login attempts, the user is given a choice to reset the password, by sending a link to the registered email address, and the account is temporarily locked. The account is unlocked by resetting the password. The administrator is given authority to activate a locked account. 
3) **Search book:** Any member/non-member can avail this option to check whether any particular book is present in the institute's library. A book could be searched by its Title/ Authors name/Publisher's name.
4) **Isuue book:** Only a Library Information System member can issue a book to his account as long as:  
a) The library has the required book.   
b) No other member has issued the book at this time.   
d) The current user has not issued the maximum number of books that can be issued.   
If these requirements are met, the book is given to the member. Different number have different issue privileges, professor can issue maximum of 10 books and students/research scholars can issue maximum of 4 books. The user account is updated to reflect the successful issuance of a book.
5) **Return book:** A book is issued only for a finite time (assumed 20 days). This borowing period can be different for differenet users i.e. like proffesors/students etc. and the maxiumum number of allowed days can be changed by the administrator. After successful return of a book, the user account is updated to reflect the same.
6) **Reissue book:** Any member who has issued a book might want to keep the book for more than 20 days, if his requirements are not met. In that case, he might choose to reissue the book, and keep it for another 20 days. However, a member can reissue any book at most twice, after which he has to return it. Once a book has been successfully reissued, the user account is updated to reflect the information. Member can re-issue a book only if no other member wants to read the same book.
